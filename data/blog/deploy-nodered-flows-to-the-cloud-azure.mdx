In this tutorial, we will deploy Node-RED flows we've created [before](../get-started-on-iot-with-nodered-esp32) to
the cloud using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us). By hosting our Node-RED flows in the cloud,
we can control remotely and access the data from anywhere. This guide will take you step-by-step through the process
of deploying your Node-RED flows to Azure, and provide you with the knowledge and skills to start building your
own cloud-based IoT solutions.

## Prerequisites

- Laptop (Whichever OS, but I'm using Windows)
- [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) - SSH Client
- Microsoft Azure account

## Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) instances

Virtual machine is basically a computer that lives in Azure infrastructure. Open [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)
and click on **Virtual Machine**.

![Azure Virtual Machine selector](/static/blog/nodered-azure/azure-portal-vm.png)

Click on Create > **Azure virtual machine** on the dropdown menu.

![Create Azure VM](/static/blog/nodered-azure/create-azure-vm.png)

In the Create a virtual machine form, fill in the particulars. Below are some important info you need to fill.

| Size                  | The [docs](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/azure) suggest `A1 Basic`, but I couldn't find it. So, I'll go with `Standard_B1s`. _Keep in mind that Node.js operates on a single thread, so having multiple cores in a Node-RED instance will not bring any advantage._ ![Azure VM Sizes and pricing](/static/blog/nodered-azure/azure-select-vm-size.png) |

Next, go to the **Networking tab**.

![Networking tab](/static/blog/nodered-azure/networking-tab.png)

in the **NIC network security group**, change the option from Basic to **Advanced**. Then, in the
**Configure network security group**, click on <kbd>Create new</kbd>.

![NIC Advanced option](/static/blog/nodered-azure/nic-advanced.png)

Click on <kbd>+ Add an inbound rule</kbd>. Set the value as follows:

| Item                    | Values                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Destination port ranges | `1880`                          |
| Protocol                | TCP                             |
| Priority                | `1010`                          |
| Name                    | Any name. Eg: `node-red-editor` |

Click <kbd>Add</kbd>. You should see your new rule is added to the **Inbound rules**. Click on <kbd>OK</kbd>.

Then, click on <kbd>Review + create</kbd> to finalize your VM creation.

![Azure review](/static/blog/nodered-azure/azure-review-create.png)

In will take a moment to validate the information. Once it's done, click on <kbd>Create</kbd>. A dialog **Generate new key pair**
should pop out to let you download your private key. Go ahead and click on the <kbd>Download private key and create
resources</kbd>.

![Azure download key pair](/static/blog/nodered-azure/azure-validation-passed-key-pair.png)

A `.pem` file will be downloaded, and Azure deployment worker will start kicked in to start your VM deployment. You can see the progress from
the notification panel. Once it's done, click on <kbd>Go to resource</kbd> to view your freshly created VM.

Then, go to **Connect**, copy the `<username>@<public ip address>` from the example command. For example, mine is
`azureuser@20.115.54.38`.

![Azure VM Connect SSH](/static/blog/nodered-azure/azure-vm-connect-ssh.png)

## Accessing your VM's Shell

### Key conversion

We'll be using PuTTY go access your VM. But, first, we are first going to convert the downloaded `.pem` file into something that
PuTTY can understand. Open **PuTTYgen** to get started.

![PuTTY gen](/static/blog/nodered-azure/puttygen-start-menu.png)

In the PuTTYgen window, click on Conversion > Import key. Import the `.pem` file we've downloaded from the Azure portal before.
PuTTYgen should be able to read it.

Then, click <kbd>Save private key</kbd>.

![Putty save private key](/static/blog/nodered-azure/putty-save-private-key.png)

A warning dialog may appear, just click <kbd>Yes</kbd> to proceed. Save it anywhere on your computer. Note that the
converted file will be saved as `.ppk`.

You can now close PuTTYgen.

### Establishing connection

Now, open the main PuTTY app. Click on Connection > SSH > Auth > Credentials.

In the **Private key file for authentication**, browse the generated `.ppk` file we've generated before.

![PuTTY SSH auth](/static/blog/nodered-azure/putty-config-ssh.png)

<Admonition type="note">
  It is also possible to generate the key pair using PuTTY, and then give your public key to the VM.
  Read more [here](https://help.thorntech.com/docs/sftp-gateway-azure/azure-ssh-using-putty/).
</Admonition>

Go back to **Session**, in the **Host name** textbox, paste the `<username>@<public ip address>` that we've copied from Azure
portal before. Leave other settings as default and click on <kbd>Open</kbd>.

![Putty init session](/static/blog/nodered-azure/putty-config-session.png)

A warning dialog might be appeared, click on <kbd>Accept</kbd> to proceed.

<Admonition type="tip">
  You may wanted save the PuTTY session, so next time you want to access the Shell, just load the
  session from disk
</Admonition>

PuTTY will connect you to the Azure VM. Within a few seconds, BOOM! ðŸ’¥. We've gain access
to our VM's Shell. Congratulations, you are now a [hacker](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/31a7b7745fb9c08b9db9bb1e981df25f.jpg).

You can verify by typing command `uname -a` to get the OS information.

![putty Uname Azure](/static/blog/nodered-azure/putty-uname.png)

## Install Node-RED

First, install the [recommended](https://nodered.org/docs/faq/node-versions) version of Node to the machine.

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs build-essential
```

Then, install Node-RED

```bash
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
```

## Open Node-RED

Now, Node-RED is ready to be started. Run:

```bash
node-red
```

![Node RED started](/static/blog/nodered-azure/console-node-red.png)

After it has been started, open your **browser** and go to `<public ip address>:1880`. For example, mine is `20.115.54.38:1880`.

<Admonition type="tip">
  You can find your public IP address from the Azure Portal (in
  [here](/static/blog/nodered-azure/azure-vm-public-ip.png)) or using command like
  [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34567038/13617136)
</Admonition>

With that, you now have the Node-RED **running** on your Azure cloud infrastructure ðŸŽ‰.

![NodeRED on cloud Azure](/static/blog/nodered-azure/node-red-welcome.png)

## Import existing flows to Node-RED

At this point, you already can start to design your flows and can deploy instantly at the cloud. But, if you already have developed
a flows before this locally, why not just bringing the flows to the other machine.

Before we proceed, let's define:

- Local Node-RED : Node-RED instance that we run on our local machine
- Cloud Node-RED : Node-RED instance that we've just deployed to the Azure VM

<Admonition type="note">
  The steps outlined here is similar then you wnat to transfer the Node-RED flows from one machine
  to another
</Admonition>

We'll need our exported `.json` file first (learn how to export Node-RED flows to JSON is [previous article](../get-started-on-iot-with-nodered-esp32#export-flows)).

Then, we'll need to list out the palettes used in the current flows because we'll need to install them. So, on the Local Node-RED > Menu > Manage Palettes. Take
notes of the installed palettes. In my case, I only have one additional palettes: `node-red-dashboard`.

![Nodered palettes installed](/static/blog/nodered-azure/local-node-red-palettes.png)

Now, back to Cloud Node-RED, click on Menu > Manage Palettes > Install to install all palettes you need.

Then, click on Menu > Import. You can paste the json content or import the `.json` file. Then, click on <kbd>Import</kbd>.

![Nodered import json dialog](/static/blog/nodered-azure/nodered-import-json.png)

The imported flow will look the same as your local Node-RED's flow.

![Imported flow](/static/blog/nodered-azure/node-red-imported.png)

Finally, hit <kbd>Deploy</kbd> to save and deploy the flows.

Open the dashboard UI, connect ESP32 like we did before and the result is something similar below:

<ReactPlayer url="https://i.imgur.com/aQmba1Q.mp4" playing={true} controls={true} />

Notice that there are few milliseconds delay between ESP32 and the Node-RED dashboard. Perhaps because we are using free public
mqtt broker, so the connection speed is throttled.

<Admonition type={'important'} title={'shameless plug'}>
  I made the Serial Monitor application that you see above. It is called **SeriLink**. Learn more
  [here](https://github.com/iqfareez/SeriLink).
</Admonition>

## Concluding remarks

That's it. You now can continue to develop your flow on the cloud and deploy it right
away so that you, or anyone can access it. The process is long, but easy to understand, right? ðŸ˜‰

Remember to watch out your Azure usages & quotas to avoid extra charges.

You may ask, how do I want to do similar like this using AWS? IMO, the process maybe similar here and there. Just try that out. If I have time,
I want to make a YouTube tutorial InshaAllah.
