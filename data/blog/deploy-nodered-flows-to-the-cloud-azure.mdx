In this tutorial, we will deploy Node-RED flows we've created [before](../get-started-on-iot-with-nodered-esp32) to
the cloud using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us). By hosting our Node-RED flows in the cloud,
we can control remotely and access the data from anywhere. This guide will take you step-by-step through the process
of deploying your Node-RED flows to Azure, and provide you with the knowledge and skills to start building your
own cloud-based IoT solutions.

## Prerequisites

- Laptop (Whichever OS, but I'm using Windows)
- [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) - SSH Client
- Microsoft Azure account

<Admonition type="tip">
  If possible, register to the Azure account as
  [student](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) to claim the free $100 credit.

## Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) instances

Virtual machine is basically a computer that lives in Azure infrastructure. Open [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)
and click on **Virtual Machine**.
