When the list of titles for the final year project (fyp) released for us to select, there were several titles that I was interested in. But, seeing the title
**"Development of turn-by-turn navigation in Kulliyyah of Engineering (KOE) building"** have caught my eyes. Because the nature of myself
leaning towards software development, I thought this project would be a good fit for me.

Upon further meeting with my supervisor, the requirements have been refined as follows:

- Develop a **mobile application using Unity** with AR Foundation for the navigation system.
- Localization system using **natural landmark detection** - Visual based without use of markers like QR code or something.

One student from last year (2021/2022) FYP's, Hidayat Sohif have done similar project, but with different objectives (See [Post 1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/azharmohdibrahim_augmentedreality-indoornavigation-fuzzylogic-activity-7023879916509163520-MFKK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) & [Post 2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/azharmohdibrahim_koe-iium-activity-7051446897596645376-bdsY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)).
The navigation system is quite the similar, but the localization system is different. He used QR code as the marker for the localization system, meanwhile I'm using features that are already exist in the building. See [types of AR navigation](#types-of-ar-navigation).

## Types of AR navigation

Generally, there are two types of navigation, which are:

- **Location-based** navigation - using GPS
- **Vision/Visual-based** navigation - using camera

My project is targeted to be used within/inside a building, GPS is not suitable for this project since the walls and building structure
will disrupt the GPS signal. It is also crucial to ensure the position is accurate within 1-2 meters, which is hard to obtain using
GPS. So, a suitable option to use indoor is vision-based navigation.

In visual based, there are another two types of localization.

- **Marker-based** - Using markers like QR code, AR tags, etc.
- **Markerless** - Using features that are already exist in the building.

So far so good, I was excited to start the project. I have learned Unity before, I already understand the basics of it, which give me a good head start.

After doing some quick Google searches. I found out that not many people have done this project before.

Lucky for me, there was a good tutorial [on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIYTfRd0Ho7iOI_cnUZxXK6KiCFGhU1s) about developing basic AR navigation system using Unity. The tutorial
have provided me some basic understanding on how the overall navigation system would work. So, the next part is to develop the localization system.

cerita la sem 1 buat apa sem 2 buat apa
tunjuk skit result

I wish I have more time and no other commitment to fully commit and enjoy my FYP project.
aku bnyak program dan projek
boleh la nak recaall projek2 aku, masjidTV
workshop 8j8a
ukm
mcm2 lagi

ckp aku menyesal satu sem tak buat apa,
include
screenshot 3 bulan tak bukak hahha, time bukak ni lagi semiggu nak submkit

![Unity dah 3 bulan tak bukak project](/static/blog/fyp-post-mortem/unity-3bulan-screenshot.png)

Point yang nak tulis:

- Overestimate diri sendiri
- Overestimate masa
- Overestimate kemampuan

Tak enjoiy buat, tktau kenapa
lecturer tak bagi bantuan, tak push

This is me two days before submitting the FYP report. I just finished developing the server and now I'm collecting data
using the app.

2 hari sebelum submit report:

![AR Server codespace](/static/blog/fyp-post-mortem/ar-server-codespace-construction.png)

CKp bersyukur masa saat2 akhir tkade jatuh sakit etc.

So, if I were to start over again, I would do the following:

- Keep the consistency in developing the project
- Manage priorities
- Don't overestimate myself
- Don't overestimate the time
