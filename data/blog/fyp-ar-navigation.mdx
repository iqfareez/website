When the list of titles for the final year project (fyp) released for us to select, there were several titles that I was interested in. But, seeing the title
**"Development of turn-by-turn navigation in Kulliyyah of Engineering (KOE) building"** have caught my eyes. Because the nature of myself
leaning towards software development, I thought this project would be a good fit for me.

Upon further meeting with my supervisor, the requirements have been refined as follows:

- Develop a **mobile application using Unity** with AR Foundation for the navigation system.
- Localization system using **natural landmark detection** - Visual based without use of markers like QR code or something.

## Past projects

One student from last year (2021/2022) FYP's, Hidayat Sohif have done similar project, but with different objectives (See [Post 1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/azharmohdibrahim_augmentedreality-indoornavigation-fuzzylogic-activity-7023879916509163520-MFKK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) & [Post 2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/azharmohdibrahim_koe-iium-activity-7051446897596645376-bdsY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)).
The navigation system is quite the similar, but the localization system is different. He used QR code as the marker for the localization system, meanwhile I'm using features that are already exist in the building. See [types of AR navigation](#types-of-ar-navigation).

I also found a good working demo of [indoor navigation with AR in a hospital](https://youtu.be/CGphw9r__5k) by [Joshua Drewlow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-drewlow/). He
explained greatly the [development process](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcYgptwJHxUE7Q9ymWEX0zDs3SDgMarxu). I can follow his methods right? Haha no becase they used
[Vuforia SDK](https://developer.vuforia.com/) with 3D camera to map the environment which I don't have any of it and it cost a lot of $$$.

After conducting thorough Google searches, I was delighted to discover that my chosen project was relatively uncommon and hadn't been extensively explored by others before. But the trends is increasing, more and more people are interested in developing AR navigation system.

## Types of AR navigation

Generally, there are two types of navigation, which are:

- **Location-based** navigation - using GPS
- **Vision/Visual-based** navigation - using camera

My project is targeted to be used within/inside a building, GPS is not suitable for this project since the walls and building structure
will disrupt the GPS signal. It is also crucial to ensure the position is accurate within 1-2 meters, which is hard to obtain using
GPS. So, a suitable option to use indoor is vision-based navigation.

In visual based, there are another two types of localization.

- **Marker-based** - Using markers like QR code, AR tags, etc.
- **Markerless** - Using features that are already exist in the building.

So far so good, I was excited to start the project. I have learned Unity before, I already understand the basics of it, which give me a good head start.

## In semester 1 (FYP 1)

First I started to understand the navigation system in Unity ie walking etc. There was a good tutorial [on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIYTfRd0Ho7iOI_cnUZxXK6KiCFGhU1s) about developing basic AR navigation system using Unity. The tutorial
have provided me some basic understanding on how the overall navigation system would work. So, the next part is to develop the localization system.

tunjuk skit result

will disrupt the GPS signal. It is also crucial to ensure the position is accurate within 1-2 meters, which is hard to obtain using

I wish I have more time and no other commitment to fully commit and enjoy my FYP project.
aku bnyak program dan projek
boleh la nak recaall projek2 aku, masjidTV
workshop 8j8a
ukm
mcm2 lagi

ckp aku menyesal satu sem tak buat apa,
include
screenshot 3 bulan tak bukak hahha, time bukak ni lagi semiggu nak submkit

Point yang nak tulis:

- Overestimate diri sendiri
- Overestimate masa
- Overestimate kemampuan

Tak enjoiy buat, tktau kenapa
lecturer tak bagi bantuan, tak push

This is me two days before submitting the FYP report. I just finished developing the server and now I'm collecting data
using the app.

2 hari sebelum submit report:

CKp bersyukur masa saat2 akhir tkade jatuh sakit etc.

I'm glad the examiners liked my project. However, they also have commented on some aspects particularly about the localization
results.

Below are the real questions asked by the examiners during the presentation:

1. Using your project, I only be able to go from and to the destination that have been listed only. Am I right?
1. How do you know that the user is in the correct path?
1. Is the navigation path shown is the optimized shortest path?
1. Can I navigate between different floors?
1. How is your project is different from [Hidayat Sohif's project](#past-projects)?
1. etc.

I am able to answer all the questions asked, because I know what I'm doing, but I don't think it is satisfying enough
for them.

## Future work

Of course, there was a very big room of improvement for this project to make it production ready.

If time is critical, i.e. you don't want to spend much time on developing the localization system, then you can use
AR navigation SDK out there, it is just you need a big capital to use it. Below are some examples:

- [Vuforia Engine](https://developer.vuforia.com/)
- [Wikitude](https://www.wikitude.com/showcase/wikitude-navigation/)
- [Unity Mars](https://unity.com/products/unity-mars)

If you have time & resources, then you can continue my project by improving the overall system. Here are my suggestions:

- Add more landmark to the localization system
- Improve the speed of the localization system (need change in both code and hardware)
- Add accessibility features (ie read out the instruction "turn left", "turn right", etc)
- Add more features to the app (ie. search for destination, etc)
- etc.

## Closing thoughts

So, if I were to start over again, I would do the following:

- Keep the consistency in developing the project
- Manage priorities
- Don't overestimate myself
- Don't overestimate the time
