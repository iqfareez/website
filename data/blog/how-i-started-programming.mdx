## Learn animation using Javascript

As far as I can remember, I think the first code I wrote was in primary-secondary school time. I had just gotten
access to the Internet, so when finding some interesting stuff such as YouTube & Y8
online games, I stumbled across [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). At first, I enjoy its interactive
math learning/exercise platform, but then, I discovered a section called **Computer Science**. It had
a popular lessons on Javascript [Picture below]. It was fun because we're playing with [graphics & animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).
But, at one chapter, which is about function _(yeah it's crazy I didn't understand what function is about)_, I gave up because I didn't understand it. So, as it goes, my motivation went down so I didn't continue anymore.

## Visual Basic .NET

In my form 4 (~Grade 10) of my school in MRSM, we have subject called
Computer Science. Basically the subject teach us about [VB.NET](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(.NET)>).
I can drag and drop components such as label and button into the canvas. I
liked it very much because I can imagine what it is like to build a software. I still
have the book we use during the subject [Picture below]. It was my favourite
subject but unfortunately, we only have one session per week ðŸ¥².

In CFS / Asasi IIUM, we learn C. Then, in first year degree we learn C++. Dua2 ni menarik and markah alhamdulillah gempak hhaha

- My first app was [Malaysian WhatsApp Sticker packs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sticker.WAMalaysianStickers).Urm, why that app? At that time, I have 0 knowledge of Android (native) app development. Still, WhatsApp has its official [source code](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers), so I yoink the code and replace all assets. Yea, that's my first baby step in development.
- I am also starting Unity game development after watching [Dani's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPmD9I2b7L8). I feel like, "Waa, that's cool." And yea, I found many tutorials online that keep boosting my motivation for development. I released quite a few apps with Unity (yea, apps, not games, hehe). The sad part is now I stopped developing with Unity. Perhaps one day I'll come back, who knows?
- I developed most of my apps in Flutter. So, why did I choose [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)? It's easy to learn and understand, and the language & syntax are easy to grasp. Things Flutter can do over native is the ability to publish apps for multiple platforms, e.g.: Android, Web, and Desktop. For beginners, I recommend Flutter.
- I wouldn't say I liked web development that much; to be honest, it is somewhat dull and difficult to learn for me. But, for things that require me to do web development stuff, I didn't hesitate to learn and explore more.
- I love tinkering with microcontrollers and electronics. I've been using Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Pico, micro:bit etc. I'll look forward to trying others like stm32 etc.
