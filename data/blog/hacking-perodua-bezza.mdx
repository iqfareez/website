My father just give a new car, Perodua Bezza to me ❤️♥️. Alhamdulillah, I couldn't be more grateful! Finally having my own
car means greater freedom and convenience in getting around, without solely relying on public transportation. Uh hm,
anyway I'm still interested into **✨Car Hacking✨** that I've been exposed to in my internship. But, what is car hacking?
Is it about ssh-ing into the car and run a virus in it? 🤔 Nahh..

Car hacking, in its essence, is about exploring the inner workings of a vehicle's electronic systems to extract valuable
information and unlock its potential. Instead of nefarious activities, it involves tapping into the car's network—specifically
through the OBD2 port—to intercept and interpret the CANbus signal. This signal carries vital data such as throttle position,
RPM (revolutions per minute), and much more.

> Uh oh, slow down.. CAN-what and OBD-what ??

CAN stands for **Controller Area Network**. It's a communication protocol that allows different parts of the car to talk to
each other. It's used by the engine, transmission, brakes, and other systems to communicate with each other. It's also
used by external devices to communicate with the car's computer, or [ECU](https://www.ecutesting.com/categories/ecu-explained/).

OBD stands for **On-Board Diagnostics**. It's a port that allows external devices to connect to the vehicle's internal network.
It's usually located under the dashboard, near the steering wheel. The OBD port is used by mechanics to diagnose problems
with the car. Pictures below shows the OBD port location for Perodua Bezza.

Once the OBD II port is discovered, I can feel my car sweats and anxiety 😆

Next, I'm going to buy the tools
