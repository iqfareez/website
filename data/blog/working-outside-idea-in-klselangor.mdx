For people who are working remotely, or entitled for work from home, sometimes staying at same place everyday can be tiring. A
fresh environment is needed to boost the work productivity and improve the focus session. Below is a curated list of places
that I personally have visited.

## Puchong

### Zus Coffee @ IOI Mall Puchong

- Located at 2nd floor, near the escalator, at the old wing.
- Need to buy something to sit there, I usually buy iced coffee and chocolate bread (~rm20)
- Free Wifi (password in their receipt). Fast (>50 Mbps) - but during my work, the wifi lost for a moment (maybe about 3 minutes), so
  you need to consider especially when you need constant connection (eg in a online call etc.)
- Your view will be some shops, and merry-go-round at the ground floor
- The noise is non-intrusive, you can still focus on your work
- Can be a bit busy during lunch hour onwards
- Comfortable chill
- Limited seating (about 6 tables if I recall correctly)
- Comfortable sitting, but the table is small. Maybe can be an issue if you have a lot of stuff or want to use your mouse, idk.
- Plug point only available at high stool table, near the barista counter (Only two slots)

- Located at 3rd floor, old wing. They have two stations. One near MrDiy, another one near the escalator.
- High-stool seating. Not comfortable, sit for like 5 min already feel neck and butt pain
- Cannot lean back, you'll be forced to sit straight
- Leg hanging in the air, not comfortable and pain (not a problem if you're tall üòÜ)
- The stool is screwed to the ground, can't move it closer to the table
- The table is spacious, can put some stuff comfortably
- Comfortable temperature, non-intrusive noise
- Have plug point for each seats (since it's a charging station anyway)
- If you choose the one near MrDiy, you can receive the Wifi from Zus Coffee below (hehe)

- Located at ground floor, old wing. Just outside the AEON supermarket.
- Spacious table & comfortable seat
- Not necessarily to buy anything from the food court, but if you want to, there are a lot of choices.
- No free wifi
- The music is louder. The enviroment is noisier from people chatting, shopping etc. Can be a bit distracting. Bring your ANC headphone.
- if hungry, easily can grab food from the food court, bakery, or supermarket
- The AC is less chill, but still comfortable and doesn't interrupt productivity

#### IOI Mall Puchong overall:

There are few more cafes to sit and work in there. Parking is RM2 per entry. RM1 for the next hour. Public transport (LRT) is
5 minutes walk away.

- Located at Skypod Residence, Puchong. Behind IOI Business Park. [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oMuf4SywBn1EDgVo7)
- I come here using public transport. It's 10-15 minutes walk from LRT IOI Puchong. Therefore I cannot comment about parking.
- One day pass will cost you RM 25. Register and pay at the counter. You'll given an access card for you to enter/exit the office.
- Pantry available with coffee, tea, biscuits, and water.
- Wifi provided (password will be given to your WhatsApp upon registration). Speed is fast ~80 Mbps
- Almost free sitting - the staff will tell you which area can be sit
- Hammock available at leisurea area (but the chain sound is noisy and annoying)
- Have 'cabin' for private meeting (no need to book, you can access if it is unoccupied)
- Environment is nice, quiet, comfortable and chill. Not many people around, perfect for focus session.
- Staffs is nice and friendly
- No surau (prayer room) inside. But, you can use the surau in the IOI Business Park, located at ground floor near the toilet and elevators.
- Hard to find food when lunch. There is only one mamak and Chinese restaurants available. However, I'm not sure if there is any other restaurants in IOI Bussiness Park.

- My favourite ‚ù§Ô∏è. Located at Bukit Bintang City Centre. [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dmYDiPvpELG9CiWF8)
- The mall is connected to LRT Hang Tuah Station. Very accessible using public transport.
- Go to level 4, find [The Garden Dining](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eR1pb1cQ5YLqFigK6), basically a food court - a large food court.
- Comfortable seat, spacious table. Not crowded during working hour.
- Plug point is available at some seats. It's limited, so you need to find the right seat.
- No free wifi
- The AC is chill, but not too cold. Comfortable, but bring your sweater.
- You can see some people and students also doing their work here.
- At the back, they have like a mini playground for kids.
- Moderate noice level. Not too quiet, not too noisy. You can still focus on your work.
- Toilet is accessible easily
- This food court area is very large, for a day I've changed my seats like 4-5 times during break.
- During break time, you can go to the rooftop to get some fresh air. As a bonus, you can also see the Merdeka 118 building from there.
- Also, you can go to visit some shops here too
- Since you're sitting in a food court itself, finding food during lunch/break shouldn't be a problem.
