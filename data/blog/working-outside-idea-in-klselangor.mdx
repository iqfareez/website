For people who are working remotely, or entitled for work from home, sometimes staying at same place everyday can be tiring. A
fresh environment is needed to boost the work productivity and improve the focus session. Below is a curated list of places
that I personally have visited.

## Puchong

### Zus Coffee @ IOI Mall Puchong

- Located at 2nd floor, near the escalator, at the old wing.
- Need to buy something to sit there, I usually buy iced coffee and chocolate bread (~rm20)
- Free Wifi (password in their receipt). Fast (>50 Mbps) - but during my work, the wifi lost for a moment (maybe about 3 minutes), so
  you need to consider especially when you need constant connection (eg in a online call etc.)
- Your view will be some shops, and merry-go-round at the ground floor
- The noise is non-intrusive, you can still focus on your work
- Can be a bit busy during lunch hour onwards
- Comfortable chill
- Limited seating (about 6 tables if I recall correctly)
- Comfortable sitting, but the table is small. Maybe can be an issue if you have a lot of stuff or want to use your mouse, idk.
- Plug point only available at high stool table, near the barista counter (Only two slots)

- Located at 3rd floor, old wing. They have two stations. One near MrDiy, another one near the escalator.
- High-stool seating. Not comfortable, sit for like 5 min already feel neck and butt pain
- Cannot lean back, you'll be forced to sit straight
- Leg hanging in the air, not comfortable and pain (not a problem if you're tall ðŸ˜†)
- The stool is screwed to the ground, can't move it closer to the table
- The table is spacious, can put some stuff comfortably
- Comfortable temperature, non-intrusive noise
- Have plug point for each seats (since it's a charging station anyway)
- If you choose the one near MrDiy, you can receive the Wifi from Zus Coffee below (hehe)

- Located at ground floor, old wing. Just outside the AEON supermarket.
- Spacious table & comfortable seat
- Not necessarily to buy anything from the food court, but if you want to, there are a lot of choices.
- No free wifi
- The music is louder. Also noisier from people chatting, shopping etc. Can be a bit distracting. Bring your ANC headphone.
- if hungry, easily can grab food from the food court, bakery, or supermarket
- The AC is less chill, but still comfortable and doesn't interrupt productivity

#### IOI Mall Puchong overall:

There are few more cafes to sit and work in there. Parking is RM2 per entry. RM1 for the next hour. Public transport (LRT) is
5 minutes walk away.
