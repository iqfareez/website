Welcome to this guide on how to enable CUDA on an [Nvidia MX130](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/gaming-laptops/nvidia-geforce-mx130/) GPU for machine vision inference on laptops. **CUDA** is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs).

The Nvidia MX130 is a dedicated GPU that is commonly found in laptops, it is not as powerful as the RTX GPU families, but it can still run some machine vision tasks efficiently. In this guide, we will cover the installation of necessary drivers and software, as well as any configuration required to properly utilize the GPU for these types of computations using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). Keep in mind that the mileage may vary when using other frameworks.

At the end, I will demo the performance using [SuperGlue](https://github.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork)'s demo script.

## Checking the GPU you have

Usually, laptop with NVIDIA GPU already preinstalled with NVIDIA drivers along with NVIDIA Control Panel. So, open that to see your GPU version.

I have MX130 drivers. From the [specs page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/gaming-laptops/nvidia-geforce-mx130/specifications/), it says it can support CUDA. If you have other drivers, you can still follow along this guide but your mileage may vary.

Optionally, you can verify the CUDA supports using Python (You need [**Python 3.9**.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/) version, as PyTorch doesn't support the latest Python version yet).

```python
from numba import cuda # run pip install numba
cuda.detect()
```

Output:

```text
Found 1 CUDA devices
id 0    b'NVIDIA GeForce MX130'                 [SUPPORTED (DEPRECATED)]

```

### Checking CUDA availability using PyTorch

Even though the script above says that our GPU supports CUDA, the PyTorch still cannot 'see' the GPU yet.

<Admonition type="tip">
  I recommend you to create virtual environment to easily manage your packages and python version
  per project
</Admonition>

Try running the script below:

```python
import torch as torch # pip install torch

yes_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()
print(yes_cuda)
```

Output:

```text
False
```

So, we need to install some tools to make our CUDA visible to PyTorch.

## Install Visual Studio

You may need to **install** [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) to correctly install CUDA.

<Admonition type="warning">Not to be confused with Visual Studio **Code**</Admonition>

But for my case, I don't install the full VS due to storage constraints, but I have the [VS Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) already installed with C++ development. I just downloaded
_Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022_ just in case. Visit [Visual Studio download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for more info.

## Setup CUDA

### Download supported CUDA version

The latest CUDA version is 12.0. However (at the time of writing), PyTorch seems doesn't have support for it yet. So, you'll need an older version of CUDA (`11.6` or `11.7`). Go to [Cuda Toolkit Archives](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
to download version `11.7.1`.

You may select Installer Type to **local**, and proceed with downloading.

### Install CUDA

Once the file downloaded, double click it to begin installation.

Click the Express Installation. It will install the CUDA toolkit, some other things, and your display driver.

When the installation finishes. I got notified about trouble installing Nsight.

As the description said, it may not be related to CUDA so just hit Next and complete the installation.

### Verify the installation

Open Command Prompt or Powershell, run the following command:

```ps
nvidia-smi
```

## Setup Pytorch (correctly)

Go to [PyTorch's Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) page. Select the setting accordingly, copy and run the command generated.

<Admonition type="note">
  You may need to uninstall the existing PyTorch installation (`pip uninstall torch`) before running
  the command below.
</Admonition>

Command:

```ps
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

If you re-run the code [previously](#checking-cuda-availability-using-pytorch). The output should be `True` indicating that
PyTorch is now able to recognise the CUDA GPU.

## Demo

I'm using the demo of the machine vision project [SuperGlue Inference and Evaluation Demo Script](https://github.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork)
without CUDA (using CPU) and with CUDA running on MX130.

<Admonition type="warning">Your result may vary</Admonition>

### Without CUDA

`Running inference on device "cpu"`

<ReactPlayer url="https://i.imgur.com/VK6pnMC.mp4" playing={true} controls={true} />

Average FPS = 0.4

### With CUDA

`Running inference on device "cuda"`

<ReactPlayer url="https://i.imgur.com/DvP0qyz.mp4" playing={true} controls={true} />

Average FPS = 1.0

The performance with CUDA has improved, but it's important to note that it may not achieve significantly higher FPS due to
the GPU's limitations in handling intensive calculations.
