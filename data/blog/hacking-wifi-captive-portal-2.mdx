In this article, I'm going to share on how you can log in to the captive portal with just **one click**. No need to open a web browser just to waste your time typing down your username and password everytime you need to do so.

If you have no idea about what is Captive Portal, hacking wifi and so on, do have a read the [first part](hacking-wifi-captive-portal-1) of this article.

## Basic principles

First, we understand that by make a **POST request** with correct credentials will [authenticate ourselves](hacking-wifi-captive-portal-1#testing-and-verifying) to the wifi. So, the idea is to make a shortcut that can make the request.

## Making shorcuts

The platform I'm going to cover is for Windows and Android, and of course, this method can also be extended to other platforms.

### Microsoft Windows

We are going to use Powershell script since it has a method `Invoke-Request` to make the http requests.

First, open **Windows Powershell ISE**.

A new empty file will appear (if not, go to `File` > `New`. Paste this code:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://captiveportalmahallahgombak.iium.edu.my/cgi-bin/login' -Method POST -Body 'user=191XXX&password=YOURPASSWORD&cmd=authenticate&Login=Log%2BIn'
```

Change the **request URL** accordingly. Also, replace the username `191XXX` and password `YOURPASSWORD` with **your username and password**.

**Save the file**, take note the folder and filename you save into. I save it in **Documents** folder as `wifilogin.ps1`.

### Android

Download [**HTTP Request Shortcut**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts) app from the Google Play.

## Concluding remarks

You can also set the script to run every time your computer boot, so that you'll have a continuous access to the wifi network.
