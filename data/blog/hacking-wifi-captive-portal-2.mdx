In this article, I'm going to share on how you can log in to the captive portal with just **one click**. No web browser needed so we can save our time without typing down the username and password everytime.

If you have no idea about what is captive portal etc., do have a read the [first part](hacking-wifi-captive-portal-1) of this article.

## Basic principles

We understand that by make a **POST request** with correct credentials will [authenticate ourselves](hacking-wifi-captive-portal-1#testing-and-verifying) to the wifi. So, the idea is to make a shortcut that can make the request.

The platform I'm going to cover is for [Windows](#windows) and [Android](#android). But no worries, as this method can be easily adopted to other platforms.

### Microsoft Windows

We are going to use Powershell script since it has a method `Invoke-Request` to make the http requests.

#### Preparing a Powershell script using Powershell ISE

First, open [**Windows Powershell ISE**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/introducing-the-windows-powershell-ise?view=powershell-7.2#to-start-the-windows-powershell-ise).

A new empty file will appear (if not, go to `File` > `New`.

Open Insomnia, right-click on your request and click on **Generate code**.

![Insomnia right click generate client code](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/insomnia-generate-code-right-click.jpg)

From the language dropdown, choose **Powershell**, and select **Invoke-WebRequest**

![Insomnia generate client code UI](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/insomnia-client-code-copy.jpg)

Here is the example of mine:

```powershell showLineNumbers
$session = New-Object Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestSession
$cookie = New-Object System.Net.Cookie
$cookie.Name = 'CPsession'
$cookie.Value = 'login%26ip%3D10%2E121%2E180%2E153'
$cookie.Domain = 'captiveportalmahallahgombak.iium.edu.my'
$session.Cookies.Add($cookie)
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://captiveportalmahallahgombak.iium.edu.my/cgi-bin/login' -Method POST -WebSession $session -ContentType 'undefined' -Body 'user=191XXX&password=MYPASSWORD&cmd=authenticate&Login=Log%2BIn'
```

<Admonition type="important">
  Some characters are automatically url-encoded. Be sure to change it to normal encoding. Example:
  Your password is `s@ample`, but in insomnia, it becomes `s%40mple`. Be sure to edit it to become
  the original text.
</Admonition>

Test the script by clicking on the **Run script** button on the ribbon bar. The output will be shown on the console below it.

![ISE first attempt error](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/powershell-first-attempt-fail.jpg)

As you might noticed, our first attempt didn't go well. From the error message, it doesn't like the `-ContentType 'undefined'` being undefined. So, remove that. Then, re-run the script again.

![ISE empty response](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/powershell-run-empty-response.jpg)

The console shows no error anymore, which is good. But, it's not showing any message to indicates it is successful or negative.

I figured it by leaving the `Invoke-WebRequest`command alone, the script works. Remove all the code before the `Invoke-WebRequest` as shown below. Also delete the `-WebSession $session` in `Invoke-WebRequest` line.

![ISE delete nonsense](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/powershell-delete-nonsense.jpg)

The script above ended up look like to this pattern:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri '<REQUESTURL>' -Method <METHOD> -Body '<BODY>'
```

Where,

- **REQUESTURL**: The server URL.
- **BODY**: Request body. It will contains your username, password etc.
- **METHOD**: POST, GET, etc.

Re-run the script.

![ISE success](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/powershell-run-success-correct.jpg)

Successful request! As shown from the response above, it shows status code of 200 (which is good). Now, test the internet connection using the browser.

**Save the file**, take note the folder and filename you save into. I save it in **Documents** folder as `wifilogin.ps1`.

#### Create powershell .ps1 shortcut

Next, we need to create a shortcut to run the powershell script directly. Start by copy the full path to your .ps1 script we saved earlier.

![Windows 11 copy as path](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/w-copy-as-path.jpg)

Go to the **Desktop** to create a new shortcut. Right click, select **New** > **Shortcut**. A new **Create Shortcut** window will appear. Enter the following:

```
powershell.exe -noexit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <SCRIPT_PATH>
```

Where **SCRIPT_PATH** is the path you've copied earlier.

![Wizard create shortcut](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/w-create-shortcut.jpg)

Click **Next**, feel free to name the shortcut whatever you want. Then, click **Finish**. A new shortcut will appear.

![Windows 11 shortcut created](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/w-shotcut-created.jpg)

#### Run the shortcut

Next time, you can log in to the Wi-Fi quickly by just clicking the shortcut.

### Android

Download [**HTTP Request Shortcut**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts) app from the Google Play Strore.

<Admonition type="tip">
  The app also offers **desktop (web-based) editing** feature. It allows you modify the data in the
  browser and sync it to your phone. Detail: https://http-shortcuts.rmy.ch/editor/#/
</Admonition>

From Insomnia, right-click at the request entry and click **Copy as Curl**.

![Insomnia copy as curl](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/insomnia-copy-curl.jpg)

Transfer the copied item to your phone (using Telegram etc.). Then, open the app and click on the **Add shortcut** button.

![Http Shortcut new](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/http-shortcut-app-2.jpg)

When the dialog opens, select the **Import from cURL Command**. Paste the item in the input box.

![Http Shortcut paste curl](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/http-shortcut-app-3.jpg)

Then, click the **Import** button. A new **Create Shortcut** window will appear. Give it the name, icons, and description as you wish.

![HTTP Shortcut wizard new](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/http-shortcut-app-wizard.jpg)

After that, click the **Save** button. The shortcut will now appear in the app. Tap once to test if it is working.

<Admonition type={"tip"}>
<details>
    <summary>**In case** where the wifi login failed, play around with the **advanced settings** in the app</summary>

    In my case, before enabling this setting, it cannot successfully authenticate with the server. Go to **Advanced
    Technical Settings**, then, check the box that says **Accept any certificate**.

    ![Http Shortcut advanced](/static/blog/hack-wifi-2/http-shortcut-app-1.jpg)

</details>
</Admonition>

Done ðŸŽ‰. You can create a homescreen shortcut for easy access. Next time you want to log in to the Wi-Fi, just tap the shortcut.

<details>
  <summary>**Update 11/9/22:** i recently update my device to Android 12, and this method no longer works. ðŸ¥²</summary>

The device doesn't establish connection to WiFi until I log in using the system's browser

Relevant xkcd explaining the situation:

## Concluding remarks

That's it, now you know on how to log in to wifi captive portal without 'entering' the captive portal. You can further customize to improve your workflow. For example, set the script to run every time your computer boot, so that you'll have continuous access to the Wi-Fi network.

(**Bonus**) As you might notice, the speed of the [powershell script](#run-the-shortcut) is quite slow. I made another script using [Dart](https://dart.dev/), and compile it to the native binary. It runs significantly faster as in the GIF below âš¡. Create one for yourself now [here](https://github.com/iqfareez/dart_captive_portal_login).
