On August 2023, I am officially graduated from IIUM. I am so happy after all those struggle, sacrifice and hard work, my journey on getting
Bachelor Degree in Mechatronics Engineering is come to the end. For the majority of the graduands, we are now in phase for job hunting. Most
of my friends already applied for dozens of company before graduated, some just started the process, while some others already secured a position is industries. But for me,
I'm a bit too lazy to start the hunting process as we are busy completing FYP and some other course projects. I only
submitted a few applications to some companies.

Weirdly, I didn't feel the peer pressure to apply for job because I'm planning to take a bit of cooldown period before
entering workforce as at that time I'm still occupied with some freelance job. The plan didn't stay for too long due
because my parents keep questioning me about getting a job.

## The (serios) job hunting begins...

So, in the same month, I approach many companies from multiple platforms i.e. LinkedIn, Indeed, Maukerja etc. I also asked some of my friends for suggestions. Quite a few times
I updated and improved my resume and cover letter to fit the job descriptions. After a week, most of the applications were ghosted, one get back to me for an interview and the rest have
rejected my applications. Actually, one company that I do freelance with offer me a position but I rejected it because I'm not interested in the job scope.

One day I saw a job opening from Telegram ([Malaysia IT Jobs channel](https://t.me/malaysiaitjobs/4078)), I applied for it and in the same day, I received a
call from the company to schedule an interview. In the next day, we have a quick interview session and was given a task
to complete to test my technical skills. The following day, I got a call from HR to inform me I got the offer. I immediately accepted it.
In the next week, I went to the office to sign the offer letter and other documents. I started the job the next day.

Below is a Sankey diagram of my job hunting process. I guess we have to adapt the ghosting and rejection. It's part of the process.

Wheww.. quite a lot to digest there. Yeah, everything happened so fast. By the way, below is the 'welcome kit' I
received upon registration. I was pretty excited especially the MacBook part ðŸ¤­. _Sorry for a bit messy background.
It's hard to keep my table clean_

## Adult life.. Here we go!

So here I am today, as a Software Engineer in [Rocket Web Sdn. Bhd](https://www.rocketweb.my/). I'm close to complete my probation period. I'm happy
to be part of this company. I'm still learning and adapting to the new environment.

## Back to the topic, why IT?

This a question I keep getting since my study life. For some who do not know me, I'm taking Engineering course, right? But at the
same time, I self-taught myself in programming and development. I think I was in secondary school where I first discovered programming.
But, my interest is leaning towards engineering as I like to tear down electronics toys (in Malay we called in 'pomen'), playing with electronics,
watch [Big, Bigger, Biggest](https://www.natgeotv.com/asia/big-bigger-biggest), [How It's Made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_It%27s_Made) etc.

I once take a personality assesment test for job. It says I fitted for Engineering roles. _(Although we can't 100% trust the result)_

At the end of my foundation studies, we were given an option to pursue with Engineering or Computer Science. I choose to stay in Engineering because I don't know,
my mindset at the time was weird. Because I know programming can be learn online, so I prefer investing the money to something we cannot easily
learn online; Engineering.

I sometimes (or most of the time) helping people in their project related to
programming a microcontroller, troubleshooting circuit etc. I become a team player in several course project eg Industrial Automation,
Integrated Design Project etc. Except for Software Engineering project where the lecturer asked me to do it alone while the rest of the class
do it in pairs (because the number of students is not even). Also, I twice deliver a workshop on Flutter development.
Which people keep asking me why I'm not taking Computer Science?

Well, I'm having a hard time to answer the question. Maybe '[sebab boleh dik](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=838137261267198&set=a.591335015947425&type=3&ref=embed_post)` ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

> For Engineering student out there. Programming is a good skill to have. Even we are not developing apps, website whatsoever, we will utilize the skill
> while programming a microcontroller, writing MatLab script etc. These days with AI is rising, don't be shock if you need to make a deep learning (or similar) program
> in your projects.
