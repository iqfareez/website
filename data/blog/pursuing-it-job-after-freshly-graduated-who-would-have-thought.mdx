On August 2023, I am officially graduated from IIUM. I am so happy after all those struggle, sacrifice and hard work, I
finally completed my Bachelor Degree in Mechatronics Engineering. I'm thinking to take a bit of cooldown period before entering
workforce as at that time I'm still occupied with some freelance job. But my parents keep questioning me about applying for job.

## The job hunting begins...

So, in the same month, I approach many companies from multiple platforms ie LinkedIn, Indeed etc. Most of them just
leave me on 'blue tick', one of them called me for an interview. But the search is not over yet. One day I saw a job opening
from Telegram ([Malaysia IT Jobs channel](https://t.me/malaysiaitjobs/4078)), I applied for it and in the same day, I received a
call from the company to schedule an interview. After some briefing and technical assesment, I received an offer from them and I accepted it.

Below is the welcome kit I received upon registration.

## Adult life.. Here we go!

So here I am today, as a Software Engineeer from Rocket Web Sdn Bhd. Few weeks before ending my probation period. I'm happy
to be part of this company. I'm still learning and adapting to the new environment.

## Back to the topic, why IT?

This a question I keep getting since my study life. For some who do not know me, I'm taking Engineering course, right? But at the
same time, I self-taught myself in programming and development. I think I was in secondary school where I first discovered programming.
But, my interest is leaning towards engineering as I like to tear down electronics toys (in Malay we called in 'pomen'), playing with electronics,
watch [Big, Bigger, Biggest](https://www.natgeotv.com/asia/big-bigger-biggest), [How It's Made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_It%27s_Made) etc.

I once take a personality assesment test for job. It says I fitted for Engineering roles. _(Although we can't 100% trust the result)_

At the end of my foundation studies, we were given an option to pursue with Engineering or Computer Science. I choose to stay in Engineering because I don't know,
my mindset at the time was weird. Because I know programming can be learn online, so I prefer investing the money to something we cannot easily
learn online; Engineering.

I sometimes (or most of the time) helping people in their project related to
programming a microcontroller, troubleshooting circuit etc. I become a team player in several course project eg Industrial Automation,
Integrated Design Project etc. Except for Software Engineering project where the lecturer asked me to do it alone while the rest of the class
do it in pairs (because the number of students is not even). Also, I twice deliver a workshop on Flutter development.
Which people keep asking me why I'm not taking Computer Science?

Well, I'm having a hard time to answer the question. Maybe '[sebab boleh dik](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=838137261267198&set=a.591335015947425&type=3&ref=embed_post)` ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

> For Engineering student out there. Programming is a good skill to have in Engineering especially Mechatronics/CIE student.
