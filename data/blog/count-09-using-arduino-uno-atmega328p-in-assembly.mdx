summary: Using Arduino with 7-Segment display to count number using Arduino IDE (C/Cpp) is too mainstream. How about we code using Assembly? Let's see how I put up the pieces together

The lab tasks given was to count from 00-99 using 7 Segment Display, and must code in [Assembly](https://youtu.be/4gwYkEK0gOk). Fortunately, the decoder was not enough for
everyone, so the tasks are simplified **to count from 0-9 only, and repeats**.

Code in assembly in awful (sorry), probably we are too exposed to that sweet high-level programming language like Java,
Python or whatever our favourites is. The sweet side is, Assembly allows us to 'talk' directly to the bare metal, solve
performance issues and understand how the hardware works.

In this article, we're going to dive into how the programs work on [ATMega328P](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega328P).

## What you'll need (to make your own)

### Hardware

- Arduino Uno (ATMega328P)
- 7-Segment Display
- BCD to 7-Segment Decoder (eg: HD74LS47 (for common anode) or HD74LS48 (for common cathode))
- Breadboard & some jumper wires

### Software

- [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio) (aka Atmel Studio 7)
- [XLoader](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BTLT7Clmqs_WUpZJBSc3pkpbzsU62Ep4/view?usp=share_link) (to upload the program to Arduino)

### Manual (Nice to have)

## Understanding the ports

The ATMega328P has several I/O pins, which can be used as input or output. The pins are grouped into **ports**, which are
labeled as `PORTB`, `PORTC` and `PORTD`. As you might notice in the image above, the lower left side is PD0 to PD7, then continued with
PB0 to PB5 and so on.

## Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)

Binary-coded decimal is a system of writing numerals that assigns a four-digit binary code to each digit 0 through 9 in a decimal (base 10) number. Note that
BCD is **not the same** as binary representation. _(Read more [here](https://www.realdigital.org/doc/2c2b7d3170b8ae3af20b528e39942b98))_
Both ICs I've mentioned above accept 4-bit BCD input, and outputs to 7-segment display.

Below is the truth table for the decoder. Note that in this article, I'm using the `DCBA` convention instead of `ABCD`.

Now, for example, we want **to display a digit `4` on the 7-Segment display**, how do we do that?

That's right. We send the `0100` to the decoder. Let's construct our circuit first.

![Fritzing BCD counter 7 segment Atmega](/static/blog/assembly-counter/Exp2-Task2_bb.png)

The assembly code would be like this:

```asm:main.asm showLineNumbers
start:
	RCALL UIAM

UIAM:
	LDI R16, 0xFF
	OUT DDRD, R16 ; Set PORTD as output
	LDI R18, 0X20
	OUT PORTD, R18 ; Pin 5 HIGH
	RJMP UIAM
```

With all of that, it should be displaying digit 4 now:

![Digit 4 on 7-Segment lab](/static/blog/assembly-counter/digit4-lab.jpg)

Maybe you were wondering, why `0x20`? `0x20` is equivalent to `0010 0000` in binary, representing which PDùë• in PORTùë•
to be set as HIGH. In this case, it's pin 5 (counting from 0).

![explaination digit 4 binary](/static/blog/assembly-counter/example-digit-4.png)

Ok, enough introductions, now back to our objective, which counts from **0 to 9** and display on the 7-Segment display.

## Back to business

I have already gone through the struggle to make this work, so I'm just going to share the code with you, and explain it along the way.

```asm:main.asm showLineNumbers
start:
	; initial counter value
	ldi r18, 0;

	; set PORTD to OUTPUT
	ldi r16, 0xff
	out ddrd, r16

	rcall main

main:
	; Output value to GPIO
	mov r20, r18 ; Copy content r18 to r20 (temporary)
	; Shift bits (according to location of the pins)
	lsl r20
	lsl r20
	lsl r20
	out portd, r20

	rcall delay

	ldi r17, 1 ; increment
	add r18, r17 ; increment current counter

	cpi r18, 10 ; compare current counter if match 10
	breq reset ; if true, go to reset
	rjmp main ; if false, continue looping the 'main' block

reset:
	ldi r18, 0 ; reset counter to 0
	rjmp main

delay:
	ldi r24, 100
	ldi r25, 63
	ldi r26, 10

L1: dec  r26
    brne L1
    dec  r25
    brne L1
    dec  r24
    brne L1
	nop
	ret
```

### Explanation

Let's begin with the `start` subroutine. It's the first subroutine that will be executed when the program starts. We set the initial value of the counter to `0`, and set the `PORTD` as output.

```asm {2,4-5} showLineNumbers
start:
	ldi r18, 0;

	ldi r16, 0xff
	out ddrd, r16

	rcall main
```

Then, we jump to the `main` subroutine by using the `rcall` instruction.

Next, we copy the current counter value to register `r20`. Same like the example with digit `4` above, we want to map
the counter value bits one-to-one with the PORTs. Since our port doesn't start from `0`, the bits need be shifted. This can be done through the `lsl` instruction.

![AVR LSL instruction](/static/blog/assembly-counter/avr_lsl.png)

In case it wasn't clear, take a look at the diagram below. So, three `lsl` instructions there is
equivalent with the pins that are _empty_.

![shift bits lsl](/static/blog/assembly-counter/avr-lsl-port.png)

```asm {3-5} showLineNumbers
	mov r20, r18

	lsl r20
	lsl r20
	lsl r20
	out portd, r20
```

  ![Atmel AVR debugging](/static/blog/assembly-counter/atmelavr-debugging.png)

On Atmel Studio, you can set **breakpoints** etc to easily debug your program. The status register
on the left panel is very useful to see the current register value. It's like a `Serial.println`
for us.

</Admonition>

Delay is necessary, or otherwise the program ran too fast, and we could not see the clear output

```asm
  rcall delay
```

Then, we load the increment value to the register `r17`. In the next line, using the `add` instruction, we add the increment value to the current counter value.
The addition result is stored in `r18` register.

![AVR ADD instruction](/static/blog/assembly-counter/avr_add.png)

```asm showLineNumbers {2}
    ldi r17, 1
    add r18, r17
```

Next, we do not want our counter to count indefinitely, so we need to reset it to `0` when it reaches `9+1`. We can do this by using the `cpi` instruction.
The next line, we used the `breq` _(Branch if Equal)_ instruction to jump to the `reset` subroutine, otherwise, just loop from the beginning of `main`.

![AVR CPI Instruction](/static/blog/assembly-counter/avr_cpi.png)

```asm
    cpi r18, 10
	breq reset
	rjmp main
```

In `reset` subroutine, we just reset the counter value to `0` and jump back to the `main` subroutine.

```asm showLineNumbers
reset:
    ldi r18, 0
    rjmp main
```

That's all. I'm not going to explain about the `delay` and `L1` subroutines. But just keep in mind there are meant to be together, the `delay`
depends on `L1` (or vise versa, I'm not sure). Let's see how the results.

## Closing remarks

I enjoy making this to work using Assembly. I hope you've learnt something from this article. Kindly visit [here](https://github.com/iqfareez/microp-lab3) for more Arduino - Assembly examples.

Believe it or not;
[this code](https://github.com/iqfareez/microp-lab3/blob/973b0a67983af0e33a4b7ecbdeac03df3d5e07ec/Exp2-Task3/Exp2-Task3/main.asm)
was my first attempt to complete this task as I don't have any idea how to do counter.
I know, it is an awful code to look at it, consisting of 100+ LOC.
