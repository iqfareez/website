Yesterday was my 23-rd birthday. Alhamdulillah, all praises to Allah The Almighty who let me live and devoted to
my parents till this day.

Last few years, I started this rule of my own;

> Buy yourself a present, because who else are going to give you.

The 'rule' is going well for past few years back. But this year, I don't feel like buying anything. I think there are
major reasons behind this behavior. One, I just started working and I still in the early process of learning how to manage money. Second,
I'm currently saving money for other things. For example to upgrade my workspace, I plan to add a monitor and a new chair, and wedding hehe. Third,
the thing I'm using is still functional (eg: a watch), so there is no need to buy a new one.

Pray for me, I hope I can get the best out of this year. I hope I can be a better person, a better son, a better brother, a better friend, a better Muslim, a better human being. Inshallah.
